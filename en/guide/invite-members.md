# Invite Members to a Project

To view and work on a project, a user must be a member of that project.

## Add Existing Users

To add users who already have a Mirai account:

1. Open the project you want to add members to.
2. Navigate to the "Members" tab.
3. Click on the "Add User" button.
4. Search for the user you want to add.
5. Select the user from the search results and click "Save".

The added users will receive an email notification and will be able to access the project.

## Important Note on New Users

Currently, it is not possible to invite users who do not yet have a Mirai account. New users must first create an account before they can be added to a project.
