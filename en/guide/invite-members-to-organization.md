# Invite Members to an Organization

To collaborate with others in Mirai, you need to invite them to your organization. Organization members can then be added to specific projects within the organization.

## Prerequisites

- Users must have a Mirai account before they can be invited

## Invite Users

To invite users to your organization:

1. Navigate to your organization settings.
2. Go to the "Users" section.
3. Click on the "Add User" button.
4. Enter the email address of the user you want to invite.
5. Click "Add".

The invited user will receive an email notification and will be automatically added to the organization.

## Next Steps

Once users are members of your organization, you can [add them to specific projects](./invite-members.md).
